        personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In
        this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover,
        assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
        statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases
        accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains
        rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year
        to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies.
        Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax
        liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be
        distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
        information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement
        benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the
        rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all
        such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with
        the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension
        plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For
        instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.
        Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
        retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with
        financial reporting enumerated below:
