      <p>Introduction
      </p>
      <p>Fall prevention can be determined as a situation or an action to reduce the number of accidents that are
        face by older people due to falls. The injury that is caused due to falls and fall are the most common
        and serious medical problems that are faced by older adults (Granacher, Gollhofer and Muehlbauer, 2013).
        When a person is facing serious health issues and when a fall occurs, then the condition becomes worse.
        As per the data, it can be stated that about 1/3 of the people every year fall and half of them fall
        twice. This type of issues occur because of decreased reflexes and mobility and underlying osteoporosis.
        Results of fall causes fractures, head injury and most of the cases even death. This research will cover
        different type of secondary research done on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>Background of Study
      </p>
      <p>There are different type of research done on fall prevention. This study will enable to provide proper
        information about the issues and strategies that are implemented by health and social care so that they
        will be able to reduce its impact and older people can be provided with better services (DiBardino,
        Cohen and Didwania, 2012). In this context, below given are five researches that are done on fall
        prevention:

      <p>Critique
      </p>
      <p>As per the articles that has been done about, in the first article, it has been found that in hospitals
        there are conditions in which patients fall per 1000 patients days in targeted units during the period
        of study (Dykes Carroll and et.al., 2010). When compared with the other articles there are no research
        that has been done in this area. This shows that there are accidents that take place in the hospitals
        and it is important that professional take appropriate steps to reduce the impact. Healthcare
        professionals should be given with fall prevention tool kit so that accidents of fall can be reduced.
      </p>
      <p>In the finding, it can be stated that there are different type of programmes or strategies that are
        implemented in order to reduce fall. The second article talks about exercise programmes in order to
        reduce injury in community (El-Khoury, Cassou and et.al., 2013). Both article 1 and article 2 are
        similar but the strategies that are used is different. Further, there are about 4305 participants
        involved and all were taken above the age of 60. In addition to this, 17 trials were conducted. All
        these analyses were helpful enough to come up with appropriate solution that exercise programmes were
        helpful.
      </p>
      <p>In article 3 there are no participants taken as all the article is based on different secondary research
        that has already been done by different researchers. This article is helpful to know the main causes due
        to which fall occur (Annweiler, Montero-Odasso and et.al., 2010). This is generally after the age of 60
        when eyes, bones and muscles gets weaker. In such situation, one of the major element that are helpful
        is Vitamin D which is important in the body so as to make sure that the fall can be reduced and this is
        been done by providing proper diet.
      </p>
      <p>Article 1, 2 and 4 are similar as they all talk about different strategies which can be implemented with
        the help of which falls can be reduced. In this article, researcher talks about inpatient fall
        prevention program in which professional will make sure that all they all precaution is taken and they
        are provided with proper safety is provided to them so that they will be able to make sure that falls
        can be reduced and older people can provided with proper safety (Miake-Lye, Hempel and et.al., 2013).
        Further, this study includes 4 meta analyse and 19 studies involved which makes this study more reliable
        and effective.
      </p>
      <p>In article 5, researcher talks about providing professional or seniors with proper training so that they
        will be able to make sure that they provide safe services to old people. This article is different from
        other researches (Bridenbaugh and Kressig, 2010). When compared with all the other research this
        research is done over the professionals and rest others are done over old people or patients who are
        above the age of 60 years.
      </p>
      <p>Findings</p>
      <p>As per the findings that has been identified from the essay is that mostly all except for one make use of
        qualitative research. Further, it can be determined that there are different set of strategies and
        programs that can be used in order to reduce or eliminate the causes of fall (Pynoos Steinman and
        Nguyen, 2010). Moreover, the fall issues are less to young people and even if they fall their body have
        that strength to recover the damage caused. On the other hand, old age people, if they fall then it may
        cause them serious issues and in most of the cases there are also chances of death.
      </p>
      <p>Conclusion
      </p>
      <p>From this finding, it can be articulated that implementation of fall prevention programmes are highly
        beneficial and they play vital role in reducing he impacts of fall (DiBardino, Cohen and Didwania,
        2012). Most of the drops occur due to medical conditions that are faced by old people. The treatments to
        falls is highly expensive when compared with other issues that are caused. Fall can be reduced at great
        extent when the programs are implemented or applied effectively and efficiently.
